        <p><strong>Game development</strong> is a complex and multidisciplinary process that involves designing, programming, creating graphics, and integrating sound to build interactive video games for various platforms such as computers, consoles, and mobile devices.</p>
        <p>The process typically starts with <strong>game design</strong>, where the concept, story, characters, and gameplay mechanics are planned in detail. This foundational phase sets the vision and goals for the entire project.</p>
        <p><strong>Programming</strong> is the core of game development, where developers write code to implement game logic, physics, artificial intelligence, and user interactions. Popular programming languages include <strong>C#</strong> (commonly used with Unity), <strong>C++</strong> (widely used in Unreal Engine), and <strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong> for web-based games.</p>
        <p><strong>Game engines</strong> like <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> provide powerful tools and frameworks that simplify development by offering pre-built components, physics engines, rendering capabilities, and cross-platform support.</p>
        <p><strong>Graphics creation</strong> involves designing 2D or 3D assets, animations, and visual effects using software such as <strong>Blender</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, and <strong>Maya</strong>. These assets bring the game world to life and enhance player immersion.</p>
        <p><strong>Sound design</strong> includes composing music, creating sound effects, and integrating audio elements to enrich the gaming experience and evoke emotions.</p>
        <p>Game development is highly collaborative, requiring close coordination among designers, artists, programmers, and testers to ensure the game is engaging, bug-free, and performs well across platforms.</p>
        <h3>Common Types of Code Used in Game Development:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C#:</strong> Widely used in Unity for scripting game behavior and mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>C++:</strong> Common in Unreal Engine and for performance-critical game components.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript/TypeScript:</strong> Used in web-based games and some game engines like Phaser.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Sometimes used for scripting and tools development.</li>
            <li><strong>Shader Languages (HLSL, GLSL):</strong> Used for programming graphics shaders to create visual effects.</li>
        </ul>
